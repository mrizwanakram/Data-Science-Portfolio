# Resume Parser NLP

This project aims to develop a Resume Parser using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to extract useful information from resumes automatically, making it easier and more efficient to process a large number of resumes.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the [Resume Entities for NER dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dataturks/resume-entities-for-ner) available on Kaggle. This dataset contains annotated resumes with labeled entities such as name, email, phone number, skills, education, etc. It serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating the Resume Parser model.

## Project Components

1. Data Preprocessing: The raw resume data will be preprocessed to remove unnecessary elements and standardize the format, making it suitable for further analysis.
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER): NLP techniques will be employed to identify and classify relevant entities in the resumes, such as personal information, education, work experience, skills, etc.
3. Information Extraction: The parsed resumes will be processed to extract specific information based on the identified entities. This includes extracting contact details, educational qualifications, work experience details, and other relevant information.
4. Output Generation: The extracted information will be structured and organized into a suitable format, such as JSON or CSV, for easy consumption and integration with other applications or systems.

## Usage

1. Dataset Preparation: Download the Resume Entities for NER dataset from the provided link and place it in the appropriate directory.
2. Data Preprocessing: Run the data preprocessing script to clean and standardize the resume data.
3. Model Training: Train the NER model using the preprocessed data to recognize and classify entities in the resumes.
4. Resume Parsing: Use the trained model to parse new resumes and extract relevant information.
5. Output Generation: Generate structured output files containing the extracted information for further analysis or integration.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NLP libraries (NLTK, spaCy, etc.)
- Machine Learning libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)
- Data processing libraries (pandas, numpy, etc.)
