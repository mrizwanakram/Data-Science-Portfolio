# Project: Face Detection with YOLOv8

This project aims to implement face detection using the YOLOv8 algorithm. YOLOv8, short for You Only Look Once version 8, is a real-time object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection-yolov8.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the YOLOv8 weights file:
   - You can obtain the weights file from the official YOLO website or other trusted sources.
   - Save the weights file as `yolov8.weights` in the project's root directory.

4. Install the necessary libraries for running YOLOv8:
   - Follow the instructions provided by the YOLOv8 implementation you are using to install the required dependencies and libraries.

## Usage

1. Prepare your input images or videos:
   - Place the images or videos you want to perform face detection on in the `input` directory.

2. Run the face detection script:
   ```
   python detect_faces.py
   ```

3. Monitor the progress:
   - The script will process the input images or videos and save the output files in the `output` directory.
   - You can monitor the progress and see the detected faces in the console output or log files.

## Configuration

- You can modify the configuration parameters in the `config.py` file to customize the face detection process. Adjust parameters such as confidence threshold, input image size, or output format to suit your needs.
