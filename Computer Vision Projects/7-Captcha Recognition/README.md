## Introduction

Captcha Recognition is a project focused on developing a deep learning model to recognize and decipher CAPTCHA images. CAPTCHAs are used to prevent automated bots from accessing websites, and they often consist of distorted characters that are difficult for machines to interpret. This project aims to build a robust system that can accurately recognize and decode CAPTCHA images.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the CAPTCHA Version 2 dataset available on Kaggle. You can access the dataset through this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fournierp/captcha-version-2-images). The dataset contains a large collection of CAPTCHA images with corresponding labels.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are used in this project:

- `numpy`: For efficient numerical operations and array manipulation.
- `pandas`: For data processing and CSV file I/O operations.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization and plotting.
- `os`: For interacting with the operating system and file handling.
- `cv2`: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
- `string`: For working with string manipulation and character sets.
- `keras`: For building and training deep learning models.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Captcha Recognition project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Download the CAPTCHA Version 2 dataset from the provided Kaggle link and extract the files.
3. Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using `pip`.
4. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script provided in the repository.
5. Set the appropriate file paths and configurations as needed.
6. Execute the code to preprocess the data, build the model, and train it using the dataset.
7. Evaluate the model's performance and analyze the results.
8. Customize and experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, or techniques to improve the recognition accuracy.

## Usage

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts that guide you through the steps of loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, building the model architecture, training the model, and evaluating its performance. Each section is well-documented and provides explanations of the code and the underlying concepts.

Feel free to modify and adapt the code to suit your specific requirements. You can also contribute to the project by suggesting improvements, enhancements, or additional features.
