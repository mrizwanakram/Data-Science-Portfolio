# Car Number Plate Detection and Recognition

Welcome to the "Car Number Plate Detection and Recognition" project! This repository focuses on developing a robust system for detecting and recognizing number plates on car images. The project aims to leverage computer vision techniques to automatically locate and extract number plates from car images, followed by optical character recognition (OCR) to recognize the characters on the plates.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the car plate detection dataset available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection). This dataset consists of car images along with annotations indicating the bounding boxes around the number plates. Please download the dataset from the provided link and ensure that it is properly organized within the project directory.

## Project Overview

The repository contains the necessary code, models, and resources to implement the car number plate detection and recognition system. The main components of the project include:

- **Data Preparation**: This section provides instructions on how to download and organize the car plate detection dataset, as well as any additional preprocessing steps required.

- **Car Plate Detection**: Here, you will find code and models for detecting number plates in car images. The detection process involves applying computer vision algorithms and deep learning techniques to identify the regions of interest (number plates) within the images.

- **Optical Character Recognition**: This section focuses on recognizing the characters on the extracted number plates. It includes code and models for performing OCR, either using traditional computer vision methods or deep learning-based approaches.

- **Evaluation and Results**: The evaluation section provides metrics and techniques to assess the performance of the car number plate detection and recognition system. It also includes visualization tools to display the results and analyze the accuracy of the recognition process.
