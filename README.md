# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains my data science projects, focused on two major areas of data science: computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). The projects showcase my expertise in data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation, as well as my proficiency in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

## Computer Vision Projects

The "Computer Vision Projects" folder contains a collection of computer vision projects I have worked on, including object detection, image segmentation, and image classification. Each project folder includes a README file with a detailed description of the project, including the problem statement, data sources, data preprocessing steps, model architecture, hyperparameters, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.

## NLP Projects

The "NLP Projects" folder contains a collection of natural language processing projects, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and text generation. Each project folder includes a README file with a detailed description of the project, including the problem statement, data sources, data preprocessing steps, model architecture, hyperparameters, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.

## Usage

To run any of the projects, simply navigate to the respective project folder and follow the instructions provided in the README file. All projects are self-contained, and include all the necessary code and data to reproduce the results.

## Dependencies

Each project may have specific dependencies that need to be installed. Please refer to the README file for each project for a list of required dependencies.

## Contributions

If you have any suggestions or improvements for any of the projects in this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. I am always open to feedback and collaboration.

Thank you for visiting my Data Science Portfolio repository!
